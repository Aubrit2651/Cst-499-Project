# Cst-499-Project
Startup Project
Student enrollment project. The picture in the list is what I used for the the backdrop for the landing page. Students must register to the school portal and select classes to enroll in. If the classes are full, the student has the option to be added to the waitlist. The students also have the ability to drop any courses they are registered to. Once registered, the admin can view the registered students and edit any information that needs to be changed. The admin can also view the waitlist, add new students to the school roster, and add/ remove students to/from classes.
