# Cst-499-Project
Startup Project
Student enrollment project. This project uses HTML and PHP for the code. This project uses XAMPP and Mysql for the database and tables. The picture on the list is what I used as the backdrop for the landing page. Students must register to the school portal and select classes to enroll in. The student can be added to the waitlist if the classes are full. The students also can drop any courses they are registered to. Once registered, the admin can view the registered students and edit any information that needs to be changed. The admin can also view the waitlist, add new students to the school roster, and add/ remove students to/from classes.
